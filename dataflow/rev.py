"""
Commit id and timestamp from the git repo.

Drop the file rev.py into a top level directory PACKAGE_NAME of your
application, right below the root of the repository.  From within your
application you can then do::

    from . import rev

    rev.print_revision()  # print the repo version
    commit, timestamp = rev.revision_info()  # return commit and timestamp

If you use a more complicated source tree then you will need to replace
repo_path() with a function that returns the path to the repo root before
requesting the revision information.

On "pip install" the repo root directory will not be available. In this
case the code looks for PACKAGE_NAME/git_revision, which you need to
install into site-pacakges along with your other sources.

The simplest way to create PACKAGE_NAME/git_revision is to run rev
from setup.py::

    import sys
    import os

    # Create the resource file git_revision.
    os.system(f'"{sys.executable}" PACKAGE_NAME/rev.py')

    ...

    # Include git revision in the package data, eitherj by adding
    # "include PACKAGE_NAME/git_revision" to MANIFEST.in, or by
    # adding the following to setup.py:
    #package_data = {"PACKAGE_NAME": ["git_revision"]}
    setup(
        ...
        #package_data=package_data,
        include_package_data=True,
        ...
    )

Add the following to .gitignore, substituting your package name::

    /PACKAGE_NAME/git_revision

Note: the current version doesn't handled packed repositories unless
the git command is available on your executable path.
