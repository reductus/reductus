Reflectometry data representation.

Need to support collections of data from TOF, monochromatic
and white beam instruments.

Conceptually each data point is a tuple::

    incident angles (sample tilt and rotation)
    reflected angles (polar angle of detector pixel)
    slit distances and openings
    detector pixel distance and size
    incident/reflected polarization
    wavelength distribution
    measurement start and duration
    monitor and detector counts
    sample environment

Reflectometers are either vertical or horizontal geometry.
For vertical geometry (sample surface parallel to gravity),
x refers to horizontal slit opening and horizontal detector
pixels.  For horizontal geometry (sample surface perpendicular
to gravity) x refers to vertical slit opening and vertical
detector pixels. Other than gravitational corrections to
resolution and detector pixels, the analysis for the two
instrument types should be identical.

Monochromatic reflectometry files have a single wavelength per
angle and a series of angles.  Time-of-flight and polychromatic
reflectometers have multiple wavelengths per angle but usually
one angle per file.  In either case a file is a set of
detector frames each with its own wavelength and angles.

Different polarization states will be treated as belonging
to different measurements.  These will need to be aligned
before polarization correction can be performed.  Multiple
measurements may occur on the same detector.  In this
case each measurement should have a separate 'region of
interest' to isolate it from the others, presenting a virtual
detector to the reduction and analysis program.

Some information about the measurements may be missing
from the files, or recorded incorrectly.  Changes and
additions to the metadata must be recorded in any reduced
data file format, along with a list of transformations
that went into the reduction.

See notes in properties.py regarding dated values.

    Direction x refers to the primary direction and y refers to

    is in the vertical plane.  For horizontal geometry these are
    reversed.  This allows the reduction software to be simpler,
    but may complicate file loading from formats which store values
    in absolute geometry.

    Geometry
    ========
    dims (2 x pixels)
        Dimensions of the detector, [nx,ny].  For pencil detectors this
        should be [1,1].  For position sensitive detectors, this should be
        [nx,1].  For area detectors, this should be [nx,ny].
    distance (millimetre)
        Distance from the sample to the detector.
    size (2 x millimetre)
        Detector size, [x,y].  Default is 1 mm x 1 mm.
    solid_angle (2 x radian)

    center (2 x millimetre)

    widths_x (nx x millimetre)
    widths_y (ny x millimetre)
        Pixel widths in x and y.  We assume no space between the pixels.
    angle_x (n x degree)
    angle_y (n x degree)
        Angle of the detector arm relative to the main beam in x and y.
        This may be constant or an array of length n for the number of
        measurements in the scan.
    rotation (degree)
        Angle of rotation of the detector relative to the beam.  This
        will affect how vertical integration in the region of interest
        is calculated.  Ideally the detector would not be rotated, though
        misalignment can sometimes occur.

    Efficiency
    ==========
    efficiency (nx x ny %)
        Efficiency of the individual pixels; this is an array of the same
        shape as the detector, giving the relative efficiency of each pixel,
        or 1 if the efficiency is unknown.
        TODO: do we need variance?
    saturation (k [rate (counts/second), efficiency (%), uncertainty])
        Given a measurement of a given number of counts versus expected
        number of counts on the detector (e.g., as estimated by scanning
        a narrow slit across the detector to measure the beam profile,
        then measuring increasingly large portions of the beam profile),
        this can be converted to an efficiency correction per count rate
        which can be applied to all data read with this detector.  The
        value for deadtime should be a tuple of vectors: count rate,
        efficiency and uncertainty.  Below the lowest count rate the detector
        is considered to be 100% efficient (any baseline inefficiency will
        be normalized when comparing the measured reflection to the
        measured beam).  Beyond the highest count rate, the detector
        is considered saturated.  The normalize counts vector (v,dv) will
        be scaled by 1/(saturation +/- uncertainty).

        Note: There may be separate per pixel and per detector
        saturation levels.

    Measurement
    ===========
    wavelength (k nanometre)
        Wavelength for each channel
    wavelength_resolution (k %)
        Wavelength resolution of the beam for each channel using 1-sigma
        gaussian approximation dL, expressed as 100*dL/L.  The actual
        wavelength distribution is considerably more complicated, being
        approximately square for multi-sheet monochromators and highly

class Monitor(Group):
    """
    Define the monitor properties.

    The monitor is essential to the normalization of reflectometry data.
    Reflectometry is the number of neutrons detected divided by the
    number of neutrons incident on the sample.  To compute this ratio,
    the incident and detected neutrons must be normalized to the neutron
    rate, either counts per monitor count, counts per second or counts
    per unit of source power (e.g., coulombs of protons incident on the
    detector, or megawatt hours of reactor power).

    counts (n x k counts)
        Number of counts measured.  For scanning instruments there is
        a separate count for each of the n measurements.  For TOF
        instruments there is a separate count for each of k time
        channels.  Counts may be absent, in which case normalization
        must be by time or by monitor.  In some circumstances the
        user may generate a counts vector, for example by estimating
        the count rate by other means, in order to combine data
        measured by time with data measured by monitor when the
        monitor values are otherwise unreliable.  Variance is assumed
        to be the number of counts, after any necessary rebinning.
    count_time (n seconds)
        Duration of the measurement.  For scanning instruments, there is
        a separate duration for each measurement.  For TOF, this is a
        single value equal to the duration of the entire measurement.
    source_power (n source_power_units)
        The source power for each measurement.  For situations when the
        monitor cannot be trusted (which can happen from time to time on
        some instruments), we can use the number of protons incident on
        the target (proton charge) or the energy of the source (reactor
        power integrated over the duration of each measurement) as a proxy
        for the monitor.  So long as the we normalize both the slit
        measurement and the reflectivity measurement by the power, this
        should give us a reasonable estimate of the reflectivity.  If
        the information is available, this will be a better proxy for
        monitor than measurement duration.
    base ('time' | 'monitor' | 'power')
        The measurement rate basis which should be used to normalize
        the data.  This is initialized by the file loader, but may
        be overridden during reduction.
    time_step (seconds)
        The count_time timer has a reporting unit, e.g. second, or
        millisecond, or in the case of NCNR ICP files, hundredths of
        a minute.  The measurement uncertainty for the count time
        is assumed to be uniform over the time_step, centered on
        the reported time, with a gaussian approximation of uncertainty
        being sqrt(time_step/12).
    start_time (n seconds)
        For scanning instruments the start of each measurement relative
        to start of the scan.  Note that this is not simply sum of the
        count times because there may be motor movement between
        measurements.  The start time is required to align the measurement
        values with environment parameters, and for calculation of He3
        polarization.  For TOF, this should be zero.
    distance (metre)
        Distance from the sample.  This is not used by reduction but
        may be of interest to the user.
    sampled_fraction ([0,1])
        Portion of the neutrons that are sampled by the monitor.  If the
        monitor is after the second slit, the monitor value can be used to
        estimate the the counts on the detector, scaled by the sampled
        fraction.   Otherwise a full slit scan is required to normalize
        the reflectivity.  This is the inverse of the detector to monitor
        ratio used to normalize data on some instruments.
    time_of_flight (k+1 millisecond)
        Time boundaries for the time-of-flight measurement
    source_power_units ('coulombs' | 'megawatthours')
        Units for source power.
    source_power_variance (n source_power_units)
        Variance in the measured source power

    The corrected monitor counts field will start as None, but may be
    set by a dead time correction, which scales the monitor according
    to the monitor rate.  If for some reason the monitor is flaky, then
    the corrected monitor counts could be set by multiplying time by
    the monitor rate.
